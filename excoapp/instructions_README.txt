1) Open CMD prompt
2) Navigate to your xampp htdocs folder (Mine is C:\xampp\htdocs, but yours might be different

git stuff

Make sure to also transfer the appconfig.js into this folder, that I gave you on discord

Start Xampp
Start Apache--We don't need SQL ;-)
Navigate to: localhost/excoapp
The index.html should come automatically
Try posting--don't say anything mean, because we'll actually be able to see it in the database
Try deleting something in the limited timeline, it will prompt you to sign up
Navigate to authentication
sign up either with google or email password. 
Use real credentials
It should redirect you to your user profile with a "full timeline"
That's all I have so far, and nothing is set in stone, but some features I'm very attached to.
